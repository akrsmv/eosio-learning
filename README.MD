This repo stores scripts that automate the official development guide of eosio : https://developers.eos.io/eosio-cpp/docs/introduction

Development machine used is a t2.micro AWS EC@ machine.

Currenly I am struggling with the fact that most probably eosio-cpp does not work correctly when running on a machine with only one processor (? might not be the issue), in any case its related to the os and environment as people report that problem dissapears if no virtual machine is used: https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt/issues/123
